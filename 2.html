  <p>
    As acknowledged by EuroNCAP 2020 protocols, testing of tomorrow's ADAS systems on a proving ground is no longer feasible.
    The number of scenarios modern vehicles need to react to in a safe and repeatable manner is drastically growing with the increasing levels of automation.

  <p>
  Virtual validation and verification are about to become common practice for all OEM's integrating systems like autonomous emergency braking, lane keeping assist, speed and parking assists.
  However, virtual results can only be trustworthy if they are confirmed by physical testing in the end.
  Having consistency in the test scenarios, the virtual representation of the environment, of the car and of the sensors is the key to successful validation and verification of automated driving functions.
